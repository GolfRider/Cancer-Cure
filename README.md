# Cancer-Cure
This is just my personal exploration on the following:
  1.  Understanding why cancer occurs 
  2.  Treatment/therapies discovered/explored over the years
  3.  Which treatments have been effective
  4.  Prevention techniques (as they say, Prevention is better than cure)
  5.  Why the treatment is so expensive & often futile
  6.  Alternative techniques which have seen some success 
  7.  Successful techniques explored by PEOPLE who have totally overcome Cancer
  8.  People have spent huge money(even took loan) for treating cancer for their near-n-dear ones,
      even when there was very slim hope of survival
  9.  I can't withstand the emotional trauma it causes to everyone around
  10. I firmly believe THERE HAS TO BE A WAY OUT in overrcoming cancer
  11. NOTE: I am NOT a Doctor, I am AN Engineer, and this is my ATTEMPT.
